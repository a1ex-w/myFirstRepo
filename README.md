As the title suggests, this is my very first repository! I am new to programming and have an idea for this first project to practice my Java skills and learn how to use Git/GitHub.

I would like to create a Magic The Gathering local database where users can type in the name of the physical card that they own and then upload it to their 'virtual library' of cards. There are many features that I hope to build off of this in the future but for now I am focusing on learning the basics and having fun :)
